## AVR Timer Programming

### Timer and Counter Overview

- Timer: An internal counter that increments on every clock cycle.
- Timer operation can end in two ways: (1) Comparing with a number, or (2) Monitoring the Overflow Flag (FF to 00 transition).
- Counter: Counts external events, incrementing on arrival of an external signal.

### Timer Modes and Types

- Timer0: 8-bit counter (Counts 0x00 to 0xFF)
- Timer1: 16-bit counter (Counts 0x0000 to 0xFFFF)
- Timer2: 8-bit counter (Counts 0x00 to 0xFF)

### Example 1: Toggle Port B Bits

```c
#include <avr/io.h>

void delay100ms(void) {
    unsigned int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 42150; i++);
}

int main(void) {
    DDRB = 0xFF; // PORTB is output
    while (1) {
        PORTB = 0xAA;
        delay100ms();
        PORTB = 0x55;
        delay100ms();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Toggle Port B Bits with Timer0

```c
#include <avr/io.h>

void delay(void) {
    TCNT0 = 0x20;
    TCCR0 = 0x01; // Timer0, Normal mode, no prescaler
    while ((TIFR & 0x1) == 0);
    TCCR0 = 0;
    TIFR = 0x1;
}

int main(void) {
    DDRB = 0xFF; // PORTB is output
    while (1) {
        PORTB = 0x55;
        delay();
        PORTB = 0xAA;
        delay();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
