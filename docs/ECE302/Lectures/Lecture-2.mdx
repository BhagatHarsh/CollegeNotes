## Introduction to AVR Microcontrollers and Parallel Port Programming

The lecture provides an overview of AVR microcontrollers, their architecture, and parallel port programming techniques. Key points covered include:

- AVR Microcontroller Introduction:
  - AVR microcontrollers are widely used embedded systems.
  - They possess various special capabilities, including USB, Zigbee, FPGA, advanced PWM, Ethernet controller, etc.
  - AVR microcontrollers offer different packages (8 to 28 pins, 28 to 100 pins) and program memory sizes (4K to 8K bytes, 1K to 256K bytes).
  - They have an extensive set of over 120 instructions and peripherals.

- General Purpose Registers and ALU:
  - AVR microcontrollers feature 32 general-purpose registers.
  - The STATUS REGISTER plays a significant role in storing status flags.

- Port Configuration:
  - AVR microcontrollers have four 8-bit I/O ports: Port A, Port B, Port C, and Port D.
  - Each port consists of Data Direction Register (DDRx), Port Output/Driver Register (PORTx), and Port Input Register (PINx).
  - Pins on each port can be configured as input with internal pull-up, input without pull-up, driven low output, or driven high output.

- Parallel Port Programming:
  - A sample AVR C program to send values 00-FF to Port B is provided.
  - Data types widely used by C compilers are explained, including unsigned char, char, unsigned int, int, unsigned long, long, and float.
  - An example AVR C program is given to read data from Port B and send it to Port C.
  - A programming challenge is presented, involving data manipulation and display.
