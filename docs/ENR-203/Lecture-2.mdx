# Lecture 2 -- Manufacturing Processes

## Comprehensive Notes

### Forming
- Forming involves applying forces or pressure and plastically deforming the material to produce the desired shape.
- It is typically used for metals and can be done when the metal is either above or below its recrystallization temperature.
- Hot working makes it easier to deform the metal, while cold working causes strain hardening and increases the material's strength.
- Common forming processes include forging, rolling, and extrusion.
- Forging is done using machines and can produce objects with improved mechanical properties, but achieving tight tolerances can be difficult and the equipment is expensive.
- Extrusion is a continuous process that produces long objects with a constant cross section, providing an excellent surface finish and tight tolerances, but it is limited to two-dimensional shapes.
- Rolling is the most commonly used forming process and involves passing metal between two or more rollers to reduce thickness, suitable for large-scale production but not for complex shapes.

### Casting
- Casting involves pouring molten metal into a mold and allowing it to solidify.
- It is primarily used for metals and requires secondary processes like machining for achieving the desired surface finish.
- Common types of casting are die casting, sand casting, and investment casting.
- Die casting uses high pressure to force molten metal into reusable metal dies, providing an excellent surface finish and tight tolerances, but high startup costs limit its suitability for large production runs.
- Sand casting uses a pattern to create a single-use mold from damp sand, enabling the production of large and complex parts at low initial costs, but it provides a poor surface finish and is less accurate.
- Investment casting involves creating wax patterns attached to a sprue, which is then dipped into a slurry to create a ceramic mold. It can produce parts with complex geometry and achieve tight tolerances, but it is an expensive and time-consuming process.

### Molding
- Molding is similar to casting and is used for shaping a liquid or pliable material using a mold.
- It is commonly used for forming plastics and includes processes like injection molding, compression molding, and blow molding.
- Injection molding is the most common method for plastics, where the material is melted and forced at pressure into a mold. It is fast and can be fully automated, but high startup costs limit its cost-effectiveness for small production runs.
- Compression molding involves placing material into a mold and applying pressure and temperature. It is suitable for thermosets and has relatively cheap tooling costs, but it is slow and not best suited for complex designs.

### Machining
- Machining is a material removal process where a tool is used to remove material from a larger object.
- It is often used for secondary shaping after primary processes like casting have formed the part.
- Machining can be applied to a wide range of materials, including metals, plastics, and wood.
- Examples of machining processes include drilling, turning, and reaming.

### Joining
- Joining involves combining multiple separate components into a larger assembly.
- It is a secondary process and includes methods like welding, riveting, brazing, soldering, and fastening.
- Welding uses high heat to fuse distinct metal parts together, while soldering and brazing join metal parts using lower temperatures. 

### Additive Manufacturing
- Additive manufacturing involves adding material layer by layer to build the desired object.
- Examples include 3D printing, selective laser sintering, and VAT polymerization.
- 3D printing is a slow process mainly used for prototyping due to material limitations.

## Summary
Manufacturing processes are essential for transforming raw materials into everyday products. There are six main categories: forming, casting, molding, machining, joining, and additive manufacturing. Forming involves deforming the material to the desired shape, casting uses molds and molten metal, molding shapes pliable materials, machining removes material using tools, joining combines components, and additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer. Each process has its advantages and limitations based on factors such as material, geometry, production volume, and cost.
