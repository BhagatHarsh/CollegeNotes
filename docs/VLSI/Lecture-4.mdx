### What is the Meaning of Technology Node?
The concept of "technology node" in VLSI design refers to a specific manufacturing process that defines the size of critical features on a semiconductor chip. While there's no clear-cut answer, it's related to important dimensions.

### Dimensions and Definitions
- **Printed Gate Length:** This is the gate length as designed at the mask/layout level.
- **Physical Gate Length:** The actual gate length after fabrication, which may differ due to manufacturing processes.
- **Width Specified by Layout Engineer:** The physical width of the gate material specified during design.
- **Effective Channel Length:** After fabrication, dopant migration can shorten the effective gate length.

### ITRS Roadmap
The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) provides insights into the semiconductor industry's future trends. Example metrics from the 2011 roadmap include:
- **Near-term Years:** Flash at 44 nm pitch, DRAM at 4 nm pitch, MPU/ASIC Metal (M1) at 4 nm pitch.
- **Long-term Years:** Flash at 4%+ pitch, MPU/ASIC Metal (M1) at 42 nm pitch.

### Dimensions in Tri-Gate FET
Dimensions for a 14 nm process:
- Gate Length (Lgate) = 14 nm
- Fin Thickness (tfin) = 8 nm
- Fin Height (hfin) = 42 nm
- Gate Oxide Thickness (tox) = 1.2 nm
- Extension of Source/Drain (Low) = 20 nm
- Transistor Width (Wer) = Lgate + tfin + hfin = 92 nm

### Dimensions for FinFET Technology Node (ITRS Logic Device)
Comparing dimensions across different manufacturers:
- Transistor Fin Pitch: 42-49 nm
- Transistor Fin Width: 8 nm
- Transistor Fin Height: 37-42 nm
- Transistor Gate Pitch: 70-88 nm
- Interconnect Pitch: 52-70 nm

### ITRS Roadmap 2013
Selected parameters from the ITRS roadmap in 2013:
- Logic Industry "Node Name" Label: Logic Pitch (nm), FinFET Fin Half-pitch (nm), FinFET Fin Width (nm), MPU/ASIC High-Performance Gate Size (um2 transistors), Maximum Number of Wiring Levels
