## Lecture Summary:

In this VLSI lecture, we focused on FinFETs and delved into the structure and operation of MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors). FinFETs emerged to address power consumption concerns, enhancing transistor turn-off to reduce leakage current. We examined the key components of a MOSFET: gate, source, drain, and body (substrate). In an nMOSFET, electrons flow from source to drain through a created channel, while a pMOSFET operates with a reversed polarity. Capacitance is influenced by gate oxide thickness. The lecture elucidated the significance of channel length and introduced the concept of inversion for creating conducting paths. We explored transistor behavior under different voltage conditions and how it impacts current flow.

## Lecture Notes:

1. **Introduction to FinFETs:**
   - FinFETs replace traditional planar MOSFETs for improved power management.
   - Objective: Enhance transistor turn-off to reduce leakage current during off-state.

2. **MOSFET Structure:**
   - Four main terminals: gate, source, drain, and body (substrate).
   - Body can also be referred to as substrate or bulk.
   - Channel formed between source and drain controls current flow.

3. **nMOSFET Operation:**
   - Majority carriers are electrons (n-type).
   - Electrons flow from source to drain through the channel.
   - Current flows from drain to source.

4. **Creating the Channel:**
   - Apply positive voltage to the gate to attract electrons.
   - Form an inverted region (channel) for electron flow.
   - Body material must be flipped to enable electron conduction.

5. **pMOSFET Operation:**
   - Majority carriers are holes (p-type).
   - Holes flow from source to drain through the channel.
   - Current flows from source to drain.

6. **Symbols and Polarity:**
   - nMOSFET symbol: No bubble at gate.
   - pMOSFET symbol: Bubble at gate.
   - Symbols aid differentiation between transistor types.

7. **Channel Length and Capacitance:**
   - Channel length (gate length) affects electron flow.
   - Gate oxide thickness influences capacitance.
   - Capacitance formula: C = ÎµA / d (A: area, d: distance).

8. **Transistor Behavior under Voltage:**
   - Applying positive voltage to gate attracts charge carriers.
   - Current flows from source to drain in conducting channel.
   - Inversion process creates conducting path.

9. **Digital Logic Implications:**
   - pMOSFET with bubble behaves as inverter (NOT gate).
   - Logic 0 at gate activates nMOSFET (conducting path).
   - Logic 1 at gate deactivates pMOSFET (no conducting path).
