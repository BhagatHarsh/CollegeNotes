## Introduction to VLSI Design

### What is VLSI?
- Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)
- Integration of semiconductor-based devices (Transistors)
- Forms large-scale circuitry with computational behavior

### Fundamental functional unit of CMOS VLSI technology
- PMOS and NMOS transistors (MOSFET)

### Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)
- Combination of PMOS and NMOS transistors
- Advantages: Fast, low-power, signal-restoration properties

### Benefits of VLSI (SoC) compared to discrete components
- Economic viability and mass manufacturability
- Performance advantage
- Area advantage ("silicon real estate")
- Power advantage
- Design tools, testing equipment, fabrication masks reusability

### Evolution of integration levels
- Single Transistor (1958)
- One Logic Gate (1960)
- SSI (Small Scale Integration) - <100 Transistors (1964)
- MSI (Medium Scale Integration) - 100 to 3000 Transistors (1970)
- LSI (Large Scale Integration) - 3000 to 30,000 Transistors (1975)
- VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) - 30,000 to 500,000 Transistors (1980)
- ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) - >500,000 Transistors (1990)

### Intel processors - Tick Tock phases
- Various processor architectures and technologies from 180nm to 10nm

### Intelâ€™s Haswell Architecture - 22nm technology
- Tri-gate structure (FinFET)
- Up to 50% power saving
- Up to 37% increase in speed

## VLSI Design and Advantages

- Focus on die (internal circuitry), IO pads, leads, bonding wire, heat sink

### Advantages of CMOS logic
- Fast operation
- Utilizes capacitance as load

### Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS)
- Forms capacitor structure
