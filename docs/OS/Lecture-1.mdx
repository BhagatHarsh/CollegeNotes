### Introduction and Objectives
- The lecture introduces the course on Operating Systems (CSE-332).
- The course aims to provide an understanding of fundamental concepts, design issues, and modern aspects of operating systems.
- The textbook "Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles" by William Stallings will be followed.

### Role of Operating Systems
- Operating systems serve as intermediaries between users and computer hardware.
- They facilitate user interactions with hardware components and software applications.
- Operating system goals include executing user programs, making the system convenient to use, and efficiently using hardware resources.

### Computer System Components
- The computer system consists of four components: hardware, operating system, application programs, and users.
- The operating system coordinates hardware usage among applications and users.
- Application programs define how system resources are utilized, and users engage with the system.

### Operating System Functions
- Operating systems function as resource allocators and managers.
- They make decisions for efficient and fair resource utilization.
- Operating systems also serve as control programs to prevent errors and improper use.

### Computer System Organization
- The computer system architecture includes CPUs, device controllers connected through a common bus.
- Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices is supported.
- Design issues include process management, memory management, concurrency management, I/O management, security, and more.

### Process Management
- Processes are executing programs that require resources.
- The operating system manages process activities such as creation, suspension, synchronization, and more.
- Deadlock avoidance and correction are crucial aspects of process management.

### Memory Management
- Operating systems allocate and deallocate memory to processes.
- They manage memory sharing and load processes when memory becomes available.

### Concurrency Management
- Operating systems ensure the proper execution of multiple instruction sequences simultaneously.
- This is essential when multiple process threads run in parallel.

### I/O Management and Disk Scheduling
- Secondary storage is used for permanent memory (e.g., disks).
- The OS performs storage allocation, disk scheduling, and buffer caching.
- Device driver interface and drivers manage specific hardware devices.

### File System Management
- The OS handles file and directory operations.
- It maps files to disks and performs backup operations.

### Protection and Security
- Protection mechanisms control access to resources.
- Security mechanisms ensure trust and privacy for users and data.

### Distributed Systems
- Distributed systems consist of processors connected via a communication network.
- Processors lack shared memory or a clock.
- Advantages include computational speedup, reliability, and availability.

### Kernel and Operating System Modes
- The kernel is a central component managing computer and hardware operations.
- The OS operates in user mode (applications) and kernel mode (core OS functions).
- Dual mode prevents user programs from affecting the OS.

### Storage Structure
- Main memory (RAM) provides direct CPU access.
- Secondary storage (disks) offers nonvolatile capacity.
- Caching improves storage access speed.

### Distributed Systems Connectivity
- Different computers are connected through a network in a distributed system.
- Networking allows data sharing and collaboration.
- Libraries like MPI facilitate high-performance computing across connected systems.
