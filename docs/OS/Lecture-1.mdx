9. Brief Introduction to Operating Systems

The lecture emphasizes the importance of operating systems as intermediaries between users and computer hardware. It highlights the user goals of executing programs and making the computer system convenient to use. Additionally, the system goal is to efficiently utilize computer hardware.

The architecture of a computer system comprises four components: hardware, operating system, application programs, and users. The operating system serves as a resource allocator and a control program, managing hardware resources and executing programs to prevent errors and improper use.

### Process Management:

- A process is a program in execution, and the operating system is responsible for its creation, termination, suspension, and resumption.
- Process management also involves handling process synchronization and inter-process communication to ensure efficient execution of multiple processes.

### Memory Management:

- Memory management involves managing primary memory (RAM) and secondary memory (hard disk or SSD).
- The operating system allocates and deallocates memory for processes, handles memory sharing among processes, and manages multiple processes within memory.

### Concurrency:

- Concurrency management deals with executing multiple instruction sequences simultaneously, especially when different processes or threads run in parallel.
- The operating system ensures processes are executed one at a time, effectively managing resources and scheduling tasks.

### I/O Management and Disk Scheduling:

- I/O management handles secondary storage (hard disk, SSD) and various input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.).
- The operating system manages storage allocation, disk scheduling, and I/O devices' drivers and interfaces, facilitating smooth communication between software and hardware.

### Security:

- Protection mechanisms in the operating system control access to system resources, distinguishing between authorized and unauthorized users.
- Security mechanisms such as authentication, certification, and encryption enhance trust and privacy within the system.

### Distributed Systems:

- A distributed system consists of multiple processors connected via a communication network without shared memory.
- Advantages of distributed systems include computational speedup, increased reliability, and availability of information.
- Designing an operating system for a distributed environment requires modifications to accommodate the distributed nature.

### User Mode and Kernel Mode:

- Operating systems can execute in two modes: user mode and kernel mode.
- User mode is for normal applications, while kernel mode is reserved for core operating system components.
- The processor switches between these modes based on the type of code being executed.
- Kernel mode ensures critical tasks are performed by the operating system, preventing interference from user processes.

### Storage Structure and Distributed Computing:

- The storage structure includes main memory (RAM), secondary memory (hard disk), and caching for faster retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- Distributed computing connects multiple computers via a network, utilizing libraries like MPI for high-performance computing tasks.

## Overall Summary

The lecture provides a comprehensive overview of operating systems, covering key topics such as process management, memory management, concurrency, I/O management, security, and distributed systems. Operating systems act as intermediaries between users and computer hardware, efficiently managing processes, memory, and hardware resources. Understanding user mode and kernel mode is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of the operating system's functioning. Distributed systems allow for scalable and efficient computing by utilizing multiple processors connected via a communication network.
