## Operating System Architecture and Virtualization

### Common OS Architectures

Modern operating systems are built on various architectural principles that influence their structure, functionality, and performance. The lecture covers several common operating system architectures, including:

#### MS-DOS Architecture

- MS-DOS had a simple structure with limited modularity.
- It lacked clear separation between interfaces and functionality.
- The layer structure was not well defined.

#### Layered Approach

- Operating systems can be structured in layers, each built upon lower layers.
- The bottom layer is hardware, while the top layer is the user interface.
- Modularity ensures that each layer uses only functions and services of lower layers.

#### UNIX Operating System Structure

- The original UNIX OS had limitations due to hardware functionality.
- Consists of system programs and the kernel.
- The kernel provides functions such as file system management, CPU scheduling, and memory management.

#### Monolithic and Microkernel Kernels

- Kernel is the core of an OS, managing system resources.
- Monolithic kernels have user and kernel services in the same address space, leading to efficiency but potential crashes.
- Microkernel architecture separates user and kernel services, enhancing robustness but with slower execution.

### System Calls and User-Mode Interaction

#### System Calls

- System calls are programmatic requests for services from the OS kernel.
- Various services include process management, memory management, file access, device handling, and protection.

#### Windows vs. Unix System Calls

- Both Windows and Unix provide system calls for similar purposes.
- Examples include process control, file manipulation, device handling, and information maintenance.

### Virtual Machines and their Benefits

#### Virtual Machine Concept

- Virtual machines treat hardware and the OS kernel as hardware, providing an interface identical to the underlying hardware.
- Each virtual machine creates the illusion of multiple processes, with its own memory and resources.
- Resources of the physical computer are shared to create virtual machines.

#### Benefits of Virtual Machines

- Virtual machines offer complete protection of system resources by isolating them.
- Ideal for system development and research, as it doesn't disrupt normal system operation.
- Useful for running multiple OS installations on a single system.

#### VMware and Java Virtual Machine

- VMware architecture enables the creation of virtual machines with separate guest operating systems.
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets and executes Java programs on various host systems.

### Summary

The lecture covers various operating system architectures, including MS-DOS, layered approaches, and UNIX. Monolithic and microkernel kernels are discussed, highlighting their differences. System calls provide programmatic access to OS services. Virtual machines offer benefits such as isolation and research opportunities. The lecture also introduces VMware and the Java Virtual Machine.
