## Types of Operating Systems

### Batch Processing

- Users don't interact directly.
- Jobs prepared offline (e.g., punch cards).
- Similar jobs batched for processing efficiency.
- Issues:
  - No user-job interaction.
  - CPU idle due to slow I/O devices.
  - Priority challenges.

### Multiprogramming OS

- Executes multiple programs on one CPU.
- Multiple tasks in main memory.
- Example: Job 1, Job 2, Job 3.

### Time Sharing OS

- Extends multiprogramming.
- Users/processes allocated computer resources in time slots.
- Fixed time slices for processes.
- Focus on interactive response time.

### Distributed Operating System

- Uses multiple processors for real-time apps.
- Distributes data processing jobs.
- Processors communicate through lines.
- Varying processor sizes and functions.

### Network Operating System

- Runs on server, manages data, users, etc.
- Enables shared file and printer access.
- Primarily for LANs and private networks.

### Real Time OS

- Processes inputs rapidly, controls environment.
- Examples: Scientific experiments, medical imaging, etc.

### Hard vs Soft Real Time OS

- Hard real-time: Deadlines must be met.
- Examples: Flight control, medical systems.
- Soft real-time: Timing flexibility allowed.
- Examples: Audio, video systems.

### OS Design and Implementation

- Approaches not fully solvable.
- Varies by hardware, system type.
- User goals: Convenience, reliability, safety.
- System goals: Easy to design, efficient.

## Overall Summary

Today's lecture covered various types of operating systems, including batch processing, multiprogramming, time sharing, distributed, network, and real-time operating systems. Each type has its own characteristics and purposes, ranging from efficient batch processing to interactive time sharing and real-time processing for critical applications. The lecture also touched on the design and implementation goals of operating systems, considering both user-oriented and system-oriented perspectives.
